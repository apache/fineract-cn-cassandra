# Apache Fineract CN Cassandra

This project provides helps for using Cassandra in Fineract CN services.

## Abstract
Apache Fineract CN is an application framework for digital financial services, a system to support nationwide and cross-national financial transactions and help to level and speed the creation of an inclusive, interconnected digital economy for every nation in the world.

## Prerequisites
### Runtime
Install Java 8 as described at https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html.

### Installation
Install Apache Cassandra as described at https://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/GettingStarted.

After installation you need to create the meta keyspace:

    cqlsh
    CREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS system_console
      WITH REPLICATION = {
          'class' : 'SimpleStrategy',
          'replication_factor' : 3
      };

## Multi-tenancy
Multi-tenancy is reached by providing separate data storage on a per tenant basis.

For every tenant a new keyspace is created internally. A tenant aware component provides transparent access to these resources.

## Versioning
The version numbers follow the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) scheme.

In addition to MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH the following postfixes are used to indicate the development state.

* BUILD-SNAPSHOT - A release currently in development. 
* RELEASE - _General availability_ indicates that this release is the best available version and is recommended for all usage.
